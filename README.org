#+title: Emacs Literate Ontology Tool (ELOT)

* What
This repository contains a template for writing OWL ontologies as
org-mode documents, with supporting functions and scripts.

Started 2024-03-03.

* Quick start (needs update!)

For a minimal check that ontology can be exported and documents can be
produced:
 - Use a recent Emacs version (current latest version is 29.2.1)
 - Start Emacs with the init file [[elot-init.el]]. This minimal startup
   file has no conveniences, it's intended only for testing.
   - i.e., something like, =emacs -Q --load elot-init.el=
 - Open [[elot-template.org]]
 - Export to ontology [[ELOT.omn]] by M-x /org-babel-tangle/, keybinding
   =C-c C-v t=. Open the ontology in Protégé to check it's OK.
 - Export to a document by M-x /org-export-dispatch/, keybinding =C-c
   C-e=. Choose your format from the menu.
