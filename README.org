* What
This repository contains a template for writing OWL ontologies as
[[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] documents, with supporting functions and scripts.

Check out the file =pizza.org= for an example ELOT file.

ELOT works on Windows, MacOS, and Linux (tested in WSL).

** Prerequisites in brief
 - Download ELOT using [[https://github.com/git-guides/install-git][Git]] to easily obtain updates
 - Use a recent version (29.x) of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html][Emacs]] 
 - For viewing your ontologies, install version 5.6 of [[https://protege.stanford.edu/][Protégé Desktop]]
 - Install [[https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html][Java]] to enable advanced features
   - Turtle output, ontology metrics, and more: install [[http://robot.obolibrary.org/][ROBOT]] 
   - Ontology diagrams: install [[https://plantuml.com/][PlantUML]] and [[https://github.com/VladimirAlexiev/rdf2rml][rdfpuml]]

If you are new to Emacs, the book [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/][Mastering Emacs]] is highly
recommended.
** Installation
*** Get Emacs
ELOT has only been tested on recent versions of Emacs. As of 2024-04,
version 29.3 is the latest. See the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html][GNU Emacs download page]].

For Windows users: download Emacs from the [[https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-29/][emacs-29 for Windows]]
directory. The package named [[https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-29/emacs-29.3-installer.exe][emacs-29.3-installer.exe]] will work
fine. It's preferable to install into a folder that doesn't contain
spaces.

For Linux users: ELOT has been tested on WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem
for Linux). It's recommended to 
 - upgrade to Ubuntu version 22; see the [[https://askubuntu.com/questions/1428423/upgrade-ubuntu-in-wsl2-from-20-04-to-22-04][guide at askubuntu.com]].
 - compile Emacs to obtain the latest version: see the [[https://github.com/hubisan/emacs-wsl][guide at
   hubisan/emacs-wsl]].

For MacOS users: See the GNU Emacs page.
*** Install ELOT in Emacs
ELOT is in active development and will see frequent updates. For easy
access to these updates, you should /clone/ the ELOT repository using
Git. 

The following steps will get you started editing OWL ontologies.
 1. Create a directory for local Emacs add-ons in your home folder,
    named =elisp= (on Windows, that will likely mean
    =c:\Users\myname\elisp\=).
 2. Clone ELOT into the =elisp= folder using your Git client.  If using
    a terminal for Git, the following will do it.
  : cd elisp
  : git clone https://github.com/johanwk/elot.git
    You should now have a subfolder of =elisp= called =elot=.
 3. Ensure ELOT is loaded when Emacs starts up.
    - For new Emacs users: find the file =elot-init.el= inside the =elot=
      folder, and copy it to a new file named =.emacs= /in your home
      folder/, then restart Emacs. You should now be looking at a
      basic, working Emacs configuration.
    - Experienced Emacs users should open =elot-init.el= and look at the
      list of packages that are required. Add
      =~/elisp/elot/elot-package/= to your =load-path=.

*** Install ELOT auxiliaries
ELOT relies on external software programs to query your ontologies
and produce diagrams. These need to be downloaded.

Preparatory steps, if needed:
 1. Create a directory named =bin= in your home folder: you will
    download programs to this folder. On Windows, that will mean
    =c:\Users\myname\bin\=.
 2. Ensure the =bin= folder is on your PATH, so the programs can be
    found by ELOT. On Windows, use the Control Panel to edit Local
    Environment Variables and add =c:\Users\myname\bin\= to the list.

Get the tools:
 1. The [[http://robot.obolibrary.org/][ROBOT]] tool is highly recommended for ELOT. Download [[https://github.com/ontodev/robot/releases/download/v1.9.5/robot.jar][robot.jar]]
    from the [[https://github.com/ontodev/robot/releases][ROBOT releases]] page to your =bin= folder.
 2. The [[https://plantuml.com/][PlantUML]] tool is needed for diagrams.
    Download the latest version from [[https://plantuml.com/download][PlantUML Downloads]] (tested with [[https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml/releases/download/v1.2024.3/plantuml-1.2024.3.jar][plantuml-1.2024.3.jar]])
    to your =bin= folder.
    For convenience, rename it as just =plantuml.jar= (on Linux, make a symlink).
 3. The [[https://github.com/VladimirAlexiev/rdf2rml][rdfpuml]] tool will produce great-looking diagrams for
    ontologies.
    - On Windows, download [[https://github.com/VladimirAlexiev/rdf2rml/raw/master/bin/rdfpuml.exe][rdfpuml.exe]] to your =bin= folder.
    - On Linux or MacOS, clone the repository to your =bin= folder, then
      add =~/bin/rdf2rml/bin/= to your PATH. Install Perl modules as
      listed in the [[https://github.com/VladimirAlexiev/rdf2rml?tab=readme-ov-file#installation][rdfpuml installation guide]].
       : cd ~/bin
       : git clone https://github.com/VladimirAlexiev/rdf2rml.git

** Quick start using ELOT
*** Add an ontology
After the installation steps, it's wise to restart Emacs!

Open the familiar Pizza ontology from =elisp/elot/pizza.org= for an
example of what an ELOT file will look like.

To create a new ontology, do this in Emacs:
 - Select a directory that you want to work in. Open a new Org Mode
   file, for instance =myontology.org=.
 - Insert the ELOT template for a document header.
   You can do this in two ways:
   - Press the =F4= key. A menu is displayed at the bottom of the Emacs window.
     The letters in blue represent /key sequences/ that will call up templates or execute commands.
   - Type the same sequence (including =<=) at the beginning of a line and press =TAB=.

[[file:./documentation/images/elot-helpdesk1.png]]
 - Use =odh= ("ontology document header") to call up the document header template.
   Answer the prompts, and a header is produced, like the following.
   #+begin_src org
   # -*- eval: (load-library "elot-defaults") -*-
   #+title: My new ontology
   #+subtitle: An OWL ontology
   #+author: John Doe
   #+date: WIP (version of 2024-04-04 12:34)
   #+end_src
 - Insert the ELOT template for an ontology skeleton: Below the
   header, press =F4= and then =ods=. Answer the prompts -- be
   ready to provide namespaces/prefixes for your ontology and the
   resources it will contain. You should see something like this
   screenshot: 

[[file:./documentation/images/elot-skeleton1.png]]

Now create an OWL file from your new document.
 - Press =F4= and then =t=, to "tangle" the ontology to a file. The
   ontology will be in OWL Manchester Syntax, e.g., with filename
   =myontology.omn=.
 - If you have installed ROBOT, a Turtle file named =myontology.ttl=
   will also be available.
 - Have Protégé ready, and open the ontology file to inspect it.

[[file:./documentation/images/protege-skeleton1.png]]

 - Export to an HTML document with =F4=, then the =h= key. The document
   will open in your web browser.

*** Adding classes and relations
 - Navigate to the =Classes= heading
 - Press =F4= followed by =ocp= to insert headings for defining primitive
   classes, with some appropriate annotation properties added. Hit =ocd=
   for non-primitive classes. The templates reveal the ELOT authors'
   preference for the [[https://spec.industrialontologies.org/iof/ontology/core/meta/AnnotationVocabulary/][Industrial Ontology Foundry Annotation Vocabulary (IOF-AV)]].
 - Navigate to the =Object properties= heading
 - =F4= followed by =op= will insert a relation (object, data, or
   annotation property).
 - The screenshot shows how checkboxes are included for tracking
   progress..

*** Querying the ontology
  - Navigate to the =Prefixes= heading and insert a new heading named
    "Queries".
  - Hit =F4=, then =obs= to insert a SPARQL /select/ code block. Write a query over
    the ontology.
  - Hit =C-c C-c= to run the query.

*** Making a diagram
 - Hit =F4=, then =obc= to insert another query, this time SPARQL
   /construct/.
 - Write a query and hit =C-c C-c= to run it.

[[file:documentation/images/elot-query2.png]]

 - Hit =F4=, then =obd= to insert an /rdfpuml/ diagram block.
 - When prompted, provide the name of the Turtle source (the name of
   the construct query) and the figure caption.
 - Place the cursor on the row of the  =#+call:= and hit =C-c C-c=. A
   diagram is generated.

 - Hit =F4=, then =h= to view the query results and diagram in your
   browser.
